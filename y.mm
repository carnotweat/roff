The first example is simple.
This text will be set in a block
and the entire block will be indented

The second instance shows how to put
a hanging label on an indented paragraph.
The identification you want for
the label is typed as an
argument to the .IP command.
The label will be aligned at the left
margin of the paper, while the
paragraph will be indented
a standard amount.

A complication arises if the label
is too long to fit in the standard
indentation provided by the command.
In this case, you must request a non-standard
indentation as a second argument
on the command line.
