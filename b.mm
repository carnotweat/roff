Now, what I want is, Facts.
Teach these boys and girls nothing
but Facts.
Facts alone are wanted in life.
Plant nothing else, and root out
everything else.
You can only form the minds
of reasoning animals upon Facts:
nothing else will ever be of any
service to them.

Three days after my arrival, walking
out of curiosity to the north-east coast
of the Island I observed, about half
a league off, in the sea, somewhat that
looked like a boat overturned.

I here present you, courteous reader,
with the record of a
remarkable period of my life;
and according to my application of it,
I trust that it will prove,
not merely an interesting record, but
in a considerable degree, instructive.

I have often been asked how it was,
and through what series of steps,
that I became an opium-eater.
Was it gradually,
tentatively, mistrustingly,
as one goes down a shelving beach into
a deepening sea, and
with knowledge from the first of the
dangers lying on that path;
half-courting those dangers, in fact,
whilst seeming to defy them?
